The Utils class is static and provides a lot of base-logic for other modules.

The utility functions can be accessed via `Utils.functionName(parameters)`.

Since this contains a wide variety of functions for different use-cases, we would strongly recommend taking a look at the [documentation page](module-Utils.html) as each function is explained in more detail there.
